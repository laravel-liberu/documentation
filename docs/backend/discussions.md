## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- discussions are grouped around topics
- users can tag other users in their posts
- the tagged users receive notifications (WIP)
- users can show their appreciation for topics that they like with 'claps'
- powerful what-you-see-is-what-you-get text editor, based on the excellent [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) library
- within Enso, the Discussions module is integrated with the Activity Log
- can be attached to any other model, via a polymorphic relationship
- a `Discussible` trait is available, in order to make it easy to add discussions to a model 
- changes to the discussions and posts are enforced through policies, where changes can be made by the original poster or an administrator
- uses its own suite of specialized Bulma styled VueJS components for smooth integration with the rest of the application  

## Usage

### Configuration

The `config/liberu/discussions.php` configuration file, lets you customize the following:

- `onDelete`, string, option that manages the case when the commentable entity is deleted and it has attached discussions.
Valid options are `cascade`, `restrict` | default is `cascade`

    With the cascade option, when a discussable model is deleted, the discussions attached to it are also deleted. 
    With the restrict option,  when attempting to delete a discussable model with attached discussions, an exception is thrown.
    
- `loggableMorph`, the list of entities using the discussable functionality, each mapped to its respective loggable attribute
For example: 
    ```php
    'discussable' => [
        Company::class => 'name',
    ],
    ```

   This configuration is used for activity logging.
   
### Publishes

- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=discussions-config` - configuration files
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=discussions-factory` - the factory used for discussions
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=liberu-factories` - a common alias for when wanting to update the factories 
once a newer version is released, usually used with the `--force` flag
