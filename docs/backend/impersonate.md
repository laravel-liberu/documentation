## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- allows a user to impersonate another user, by using a middleware
- permits testing and debugging from the perspective of another user, without needing his credentials
- comes with its own controller and routes that permit starting and stopping the impersonation process
- uses the [Permission Manager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/PermissionManager) package in order to be able to verify permissions
- the access for the impersonation process is determined by the (admin) user's access to the impersonation routes.
