## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- can be used to attach addresses to any entity, via a polymorphic relationship
- allows saving of multiple addresses for an addresable entity
- features an easy flow for setting the default address 
- comes with an additional table for Countries, with all the countries pre-populated
- brings its own free-form form for the edit and creation of addresses
- has a publishable configuration file where you can customize the module to your liking 
- includes an `Addressable` trait, for defining relationships and attributes
- the package as whole is designed to be extendable, so you could create custom versions for specific countries

## Usage

1. you may publish the configuration and customize the options as needed
2. use the package's `Addresable` trait for the models you want to make addressable
3. insert the `Addreses` vue component where required in your pages/components, see the 
front end implementation [docs](https://docs.liberu.co.uk/frontend/accessories.html#addresses) for the available options

### Configuration

Inside the `config/enso/addresses.php` file, you'll find several customization options:
- `onDelete`, string, option that manages the case when the commentable entity is deleted 
    and it has attached discussions. Valid options are `cascade`, `restrict` | default is `cascade`

    With the cascade option, when a discussable model is deleted, the discussions attached to it are also deleted. 
    With the restrict option,  when attempting to delete a discussable model with attached discussions, an exception is thrown.
- `loggableMorph`, the list of entities using the addressable functionality, 
    each mapped to its respective loggable attribute. For example: 
    ```php
    'addressable' => [
        Company::class => 'name',
    ],
    ```
- `streetTypes`, the list of street types shown in the form's street type select
- `buildingTypes`, same as above, for buildings
- `label`, label configuration options:
    - `separator`, the separator used when composing labels, default `-`
    - `attributes`, the list of attributes used for the label, default: `'localityName', 'street', 'number'`

### Extending the addresses

In your project you may have the need to alter and or extend the addresses structure by 
adding/removing table columns.
To achieve this, you'd need to:
- add migration(s) to your local project, making the necessary changes. Note that if using 
    sqlite for testing, some of the migration commands may not be available
- create a local model which extends the package model and set the proper `$fillable` attribute, 
    define relations, etc.    
- create a local template and set the path in addresses configuration, 
    under the `enso.addresses.formTemplate` key. Also, you may mark any form fields as custom and then 
    customize them in your page, using slots (like for the VueForm). 
- create a new form builder, extend the one in the package (`AddressForm`), and specify the `TemplatePath`
    to your previously created template.    
- create a new request validation and extend the one in the package (`ValidateAddressRequest`)
- bind your local implementations of the model, request and the form builder to their package counterparts
    in your local `AppServiceProvider`

```php
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public $bindings = [
        ValidateAddressRequest::class => MyValidateddressRequest::class,
        AddressForm::class => MyForm::class,
        Address::class => MyAddress::class,
    ]; 

    ...
}
```

::: tip
Note that if you just want to customize the label for the address, you may simply publish and customize the 
`label` section of the config (see the Configuration section above).
