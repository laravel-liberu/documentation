## Installation

install using composer: `composer require laravel-enso/pdf`

## Features

- is a small wrapper that uses [laravel-snappy](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy) under the hood
using the [pdftk](https://github.com/mikehaertl/php-pdftk) package for this purpose
- utilizes a series of common defaults for the page, with the option of overriding them
    - setting the page orientation to landscape (by default is portrait)
    - setting options for the snappy pdf object, such as margins, footer, etc. (for more options, look [here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt))
- can provide the generated pdf document inline (for downloads) or save the file to disk    

## Usage

In order to generate a PDF using the default options, 
you need to provide a view together with the set of variables for that view,
and then call the `inline` method:
```php
$pdf = new Pdf();
$pdf->loadView(
  'pdf.myBlade', 
  [
      'data' => $myData
  ]
)
->inline();
```

If you want to customize the defaults, before calling the `inline` method, 
you may chain any modifier methods:

```php
 $pdf = new Pdf();
 $pdf->loadView(
   'pdf.myBlade', 
   [
       'data' => $myData
   ]
 )
 ->landscape()
 ->inline();
 ```
 
## Available methods

The following methods are required:
* `loadView(string $view, array $attributes)`, loads/sets the view that is to be used
for the generation of the pdf, together with the attributes used in that view
* `inline()`, generates the pdf and returns it as a stream, for download OR
* `save($filePath)`, generates the pdf and saves it on the given path

The following modifier methods are available:
* `landscape()`, set the page orientation as landscape (default is portrait)
* `setOption(string $option, $value)`, set the value for the given option. 
For a list of options, look [here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt)
