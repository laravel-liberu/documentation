Simple to use, customizable, Laravel Model history tracking utility trait

This package can work independently of the [Liberu](https://github.com/laravel-liberu/Liberu) ecosystem.

For live examples and demos, you may visit [liberu.co.uk](https://www.liberu.co.uk)

## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Liberu.

To install outside of Liberu: `composer require laravel-liberu/history-tracker`

## Features

The trait helps keep track of the changes made to a model by saving a snapshot for each relevant update of the model to a different 'history' table.

The records in the history table are linked via FK to the original model. Setting a FK *constraint* on the DB column may be set if necessary.

## Usage

You can choose the attributes you want to track from the model by declaring them as fillable in the history model.

When the model is created, an initial snapshot of the desired attributes is saved. When the model is updated, if any one of the tracked attributes has changed, a new snapshot/history entry is persisted.  

1. Create a histories table, such as `model_histories` - where model is what you need to keep track of.

2. Create a corresponding history model, such as `ModelHistory` and add as fillable the attributes you want tracked:

```php 
protected $fillable = ['tracked', 'attributes', 'list'];
```

::: warning
Don't forget to also have the FK column for the relationship to the tracked model.
:::

3. Use the trait in the tracked model:

```php
use HistoryTracker;
```

4. Add the `$historyModel` property to the tracked model:

```php
protected $historyModel = ModelHistory::class;
```

The trait also defines a relationship to the history model instances, 
so you can access the snapshots by calling `histories`:

```php
$myModel->histories;
```
