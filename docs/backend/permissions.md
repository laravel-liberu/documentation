## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- permissions are managed based on the user role
- allows creating, updating and deleting of permissions for each route
- has the `access-route` policy which can be used to check if the a user is authorized on a given route
- comes with the `VerifyRouteAccess` middleware that checks against unauthorized access

## Usage

- inside `web.php` there is a route for each action within the application, and each route has the `name` attribute defined
- for each route where we need to have authorization checks, we must define a permission, permission which needs to have the same name as the route
- routes: 
    - are nested, the resulting name looking something like `group1.group2...route`
    - when creating new routes, be sure to follow the Enso convention and use camelCase (`myGroup.myRoute`) instead of snake_case(`my_group.my_route`) or mix-n-matching. 
    This will make for a more consistent feel and also ensure the Enso logic will work as designed.
- for each request we check the existence of the link between the user's role and the permission for the request's route
- permissions' attributes:
     - name: see above
     - description - is human readable and is used when displaying a user's action history (on his profile page)
     - type - may be `read` or `write` and is an informative flag
     - is_default - flag which lets us know if a permission needs to be automatically allotted to any new role we create
- for routes where we don't need to have authorization checks, permissions are not mandatory, **BUT**
- if we want to log and display the users' actions, permissions become necessary, as they're used when displaying statistics
- permissions are automatically grouped together, based on their segments, in the UI, for presentation and functional purposes, so 
administrators can easily configure roles
