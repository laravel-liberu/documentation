## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- provides a common functionality for managing companies within the Enso ecosystem
- integrates with the [People](https://github.com/laravel-enso/People) package so you can associate people to companies
- can be reused and integrated with other modules which might deal with companies (e.g. suppliers ) 
or even other entities, such as people (e.g. clients)
- a `CompanyFactory` is included by default in the package
- the companies server-side select functionality is also included by default

## Usage

### Under the Hood

- the model comes with a `mandatary` relationship to a person. Of course, the mandatary is optional.
You can only set as mandatary one of the people associated to the company.
- once the company has activity in the system (through any other model relationship), it cannot be deleted
- the proper way to delete a company is to first delete any other models it is linked to 
- a placeholder types enum in included in the package that is meant to be extended as/if required
- all `Company` attributes are fillable
- note that the `onDelete` [DocumentsManager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/DocumentsManager) configuration option will affect
what happens to the linked documents when you attempt to delete a company. 

### Configuration

The `config/enso/companies.php` configuration file, lets you customize the following:
- `formTemplate` - string, is the project relative path to the companies form template, 
useful for overriding the original
- `tableTemplate` - string, is the project relative path to the companies table template, 
useful for overriding the original

### Extending the companies

In your project you may have the need to alter and or extend the companies structure by changing table columns.
To achieve this, you'd need to:
- add migration(s) to your local project, making the necessary changes
- create a new template for the companies form, and declare it in the config (`formTemplate`)
- create a new template for the companies table, and declare it in the config (`tableTemplate`)
- create a new company request validation
- bind your local implementation to the package's `ValidateCompanyRequest` in your local `AppServiceProvider` 

    ```php
        use LaravelLiberu\Companies\app\Http\Requests\ValidateCompanyStore;
        use App\Http\Requests\ValidateCompanyStoreRequest as LocalCompanyStore;
        use LaravelLiberu\Companies\app\Http\Requests\ValidateCompanyUpdate;
        use App\Http\Requests\ValidateCompanyUpdateRequest as LocalCompanyUpdate;
        
        public function boot()
        {
            $this->app->bind(ValidateCompanyStore::class, function () {
                return new LocalCompanyStore();
            });
            $this->app->bind(ValidateCompanyUpdate::class, function () {
                return new LocalCompanyUpdate();
            });
            $this->app->bind(EnsoCompany::class, function () {
              return new Company();
            });
        }
        ```  

## Publishes
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=companies-config` - configuration file
