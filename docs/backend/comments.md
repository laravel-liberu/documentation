## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

The package offers a quick and easy flow for adding comments to any model.

- gives the possibility to add, update and delete comments
- has the option of tagging other users in the comments using `@` and the user name
- users are notified via push [Notifications](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Notifications) when they are tagged
- uses its own policies to ensure users edit comments only when they are allowed to do so
- uses [TrackWho](https://github.com/laravel-enso/TrackWho) to keep track of the users that are posting comments
- depends on [Avatar Manager](https://github.com/laravel-enso/AvatarManager) to display user avatars, when available
- uses a light, internal mechanism for tagged user auto-completion
- polymorphic relationships are used, which makes it possible to attach comments to any other entity

## Usage

1. you may publish the configuration and customize the options as needed
2. add the `Commentable` trait in the Model to which you need to add comments. 
    You can then use the `$model->comments` relationship
3. since users post comments, and users can tag other users, the `User` model has the `Comments` trait, 
    which gives you access to the user's comments, as well as the comments he's tagged in 
4. if you need to customize the `CommentTagNotification` you need to publish it first with
    `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=comments-notification`
5. insert the `Comments` vue component where required in your pages/components, see the 
   front end implementation [docs](https://docs.liberu.co.uk/frontend/accessories.html#comments) for the available options

### Configuration
In the `config/enso/comments.php` configuration file you may set the following options:

- `editableTimeLimit`, number, the amount of seconds after which a comment is no longer editable | default is `24 * 60 * 60` seconds (1 day)
- `onDelete`, string, option that manages the case when the commentable entity is deleted and it has attached addresses.
Valid options are `cascade`, `restrict` | default is `cascade`

    With the cascade option, when a commentable model is deleted, the comments attached to it are also deleted. 
    With the restrict option,  when attempting to delete a commentable model with attached comments, an exception is thrown.
    
- `loggableMorph`, the list of entities using the commentable functionality, each mapped to its respective loggable attribute
For example: 
    ```php
    'commentable' => [
        Company::class => 'name',
    ],
    ```

   This configuration option is used for activity logging.

### Extending the comments

In your project you may have the need to alter and or extend the comment notification.
To achieve this, you'd need to:
- create a new CommentTagNotification, ensuring it implements the `NotifiesTaggedUsers` marker interface. 
- bind your local implementation to the interface in your local `AppServiceProvider`
