## Installation

Comes pre-installed in Enso.

## Features

- allows for a user friendly way of teaching users how to use the interface of the application
- permits adding, updating and deleting tutorial entries that can then be played for the selected route
- the tutorial functionality may be started/restarted from the right-hand sidebar, using the `?` button
- the `tutorials` table is used for the tutorial module and has several key attributes:
   - `permission_id` -  the permission where they're in use, since permissions are tied to routes, 
   and we're using permissions to know which tutorials to load for a page
   - `element` - identifies the element within the DOM, and may be an element, an id, in which case it should be 
   prefixed with a `#` or a class, in which case it should be prefixed with `.` or a combination of these
   - `placement` -  sets the position of the tutorial dialog, relative to the DOM element, 
   and can be: `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right`
   - `order_index` - gives the order in which a particular tutorial element should be displayed, 
   in the context of the available tutorials for a certain page

## Publishes
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tutorials-factory` - the factory for the `Tutorial` model
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-factories` - a common alias for when wanting to update the factories,
once a newer version is released, usually used with the `--force` flag
