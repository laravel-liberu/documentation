## Usage
The component cannot be used outside of the Enso ecosystem.

### Demo

For live examples and demos, you may visit [liberu.co.uk](https://www.liberu.co.uk)

## Installation

Install the package:
```
yarn add @liberu-ui/calendar
```

(within Enso, remember to `cd` into the `client` folder before installing front-end assets)

## Usage

In order to start using the calendar functionality, create a new calendar 
from the 'plus' button in the calendar page. 

Then:
- to create an event, click and hold on the desired day in the calendar, 
on empty/available space
- to edit an event, double click the event
- to delete an event, click and hold an existing event
- to 'resize' an event, drag on the event's edge

::: tip
Note that you may not edit events that are read-only - when double-clicking on such events,
nothing will happen.
