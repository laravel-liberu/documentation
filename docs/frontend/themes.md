Liberu UI Themes

This package is meant to be used only in the Liberu ecosystem.

For live examples and demos, you may visit [liberu.co.uk](https://www.liberu.co.uk)

## Installation

Install the package:
```
yarn add @liberu-ui/themes
```

(within Liberu, remember to `cd` into the `client` folder before installing front-end assets)

The package has the two default Liberu themes, one light and one dark.

## Removing themes

If you remove one of your themes, note that the theme selector will no longer be visible in the right settings side bar.

## Customizing the themes

You may use `patch-package` to make a patch and save the changes you may have made to the themes.

Since our themes are built on top of Bulma, its variables are customized in the `dark` and `light` sub-folders. 

## Contributions

Thank you to all the people who already contributed to Liberu!
