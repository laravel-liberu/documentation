### Exports

`@liberu-ui/confirmation/bulma`:
- `Confirmation`,

`@liberu-ui/confirmation`:
- `CoreConfirmation`,

## Usage

### bulma/Confirmation.vue
This is the main bulma styled component. It has a default slot where a clickable element should be placed.
 
It can optionally have:
- a confirm action button/link
- a cancel action button/link

Example:
```vue
<confirmation placement="bottom"
    @confirm="doSomething">
    <span class="icon is-small has-text-danger">
        <fa icon="trash-alt"/>
    </span>
</confirmation>
```

Slots:
- `default`, main content goes here

### components/Confirmation.vue
The component is a base component for the confirmation component above without any styling.

It can be used for creating a custom confirmation with your CSS style of choice.

It uses the `v-popover` component from `v-tooltip`.

#### Slots
- `default`, main content goes here
- `confirm`, a custom control for the confirm action can go here, scoped, exposes the `confirm` method
- `cancel`, a custom control for the cancel action can go here, scoped, exposes the `cancel` method

If a confirm/cancel control is provided, the control should call the confirm/cancel method 
made exposed on the slot.

Both these methods emit a `confirm` respectively `cancel` event, that should be 
handled on the parent, as required.

Methods:
- `cancel()`, closes the dialog & emits a `cancel` event
- `confirm()`, closes the dialog & emits a `confirm` event
