# Getting Started

## Requirements

* See the [Laravel server requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/installation#server-requirements).
* Laravel Enso uses the `json` data type.
    * If using MySQL, [a minimum version of 5.7.8 is required](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html).
    * If using MariaDB, [a minimum version of 10.2.7 is required](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/json-data-type).

## Installation Steps

1. Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso.git --depth 1`

2. Within the project folder run `composer install`

3. Create a database for your site (see the [Laravel database documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/database)), 
copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, 
edit the database configuration information, and run `php artisan key:generate`

4. In order to serve the back-end API, take a look at the Local Development Server section of the [Laravel installation documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/#installation)
and consider using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/valet) for a better experience

    **Important**: once you're chosen your app's name and set the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file, 
    make sure you also add the domain to the list of domains in the `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS`. For example:
    
    ```
    ...
    APP_URL=http://enso.test
    ...
    SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1:8000,localhost:8080,::1,enso.test
    ```

5. Run `php artisan migrate --seed`

6. Open the `client` folder, copy the `.env.example` file, save it as `.env` and set the URL 
for the back-end API (which you've configured at step 4)

7. Run `yarn && yarn build`

8. Launch the site and log into the project with user: `admin@liberu.co.uk`, password: `password`

9. For live reload / hot module replacement functionality run `client/yarn serve`

### Optional

10. Setup the configuration files as needed in `config/enso/*.php`
11. You may remove the following files from the cloned repository:
    - `.styleci.yml`
    - `.travis.yml`
    - `docker-compose.yml` (if not using Docker)  

Enjoy!

## Docker
Laravel Enso comes with a simple docker environment to help with development. 
By default, it has two containers, the enso container and the enso-mysql container. 
There is also an optional phpmyadmin container that can be used by removing the commented
lines in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Containers

- The enso container runs the apache webserver and has `yarn` & `composer` installed.
- The enso-mysql container handle's the database the default user is `root` with a blank password and the default database is `enso`
- The enso-phpmyadmin container is optional and attaches a phpMyAdmin instance the the enso-mysql database.

#### Steps to use

- Rename .env.example to .env and fill out the appropriate variables.
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers. 
To daemonize the process run `docker-compose up --build -d`.
- Enter into the enso container to begin the enso installation with `docker exec -it enso bash`
- Install laravel enso following the [guide](https://docs.liberu.co.uk/guide/getting-started.html).

### Known issues

* When you run `php artisan migrate --seed`, you may hit an error in the form `SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes`. If so:
    * See [this post](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-5-4-key-too-long-error) for details on how to address the error.
    * After addressing the error, drop all tables from your site database (or delete and recreate the database), then run `php artisan migrate --seed` again.
